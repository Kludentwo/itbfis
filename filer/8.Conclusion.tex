\subsection{Discussion}
\textbf{Eye tracking:}\\
If we have had an eye tracker we could have seen which parts of our prototype the user spent most time looking at. This would help improve our prototype in order to remove possible visual noise sources. Alternately we could improve the user interface if we see in the eyes patterns that the person is searching through the interface for a longer period of time.
