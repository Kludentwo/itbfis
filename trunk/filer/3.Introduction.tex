\chapter{Introduction}
The project CRIP is, as described in the "itbfis\_course\_note", an interface to help and ease the everyday life of the elderly, chronically ill and their family and care givers. It should be intuitive to use and it should help make information and measurements more reliable, eg. blood pressure measurements, weight measurement  etc. \\
Since this product addresses to the elderly and chronically ill it is very important to have high affordance (måske det er forkert at skrive at det er affordance måske det bare er "learnability" vi vil have). Since the elderly doesn't have much knowledge of computers and modern technology it is important to make it usable for them as well.
