\chapter{Introduction}
The project CRIP is, as described in the "itbfis\_course\_note", an interface to help and ease the everyday life of the elderly, chronically ill and their family and care givers. It should be intuitive to use and it should help make information and measurements more reliable, eg. blood preasure measurements, weight measurement  etc. \\
Since this product adressess to the elderly and cronically ill it is very important to have high affordance (måske det er forkert at skrive at det er affordance måske det bare er "learnability" vi vil have). Since the elderly doesn't have much knowladge of computers and modern technollogy it is important to make it usable for them aswell.
